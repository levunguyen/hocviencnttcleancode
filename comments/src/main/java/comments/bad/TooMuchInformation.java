	RFC 2045 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
	Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies
	section 6.8. Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding
	The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
	strings of 4 encoded characters. Proceeding from left to right, a
	24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input groups.
	These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each
	of which is translated into a single digit in the base64 alphabet.
	When encoding a bit stream via the base64 encoding, the bit stream
	must be presumed to be ordered with the most-significant-bit first.
	That is, the first bit in the stream will be the high-order bit in
	the first 8-bit byte, and the eighth bit will be the low-order bit in
	the first 8-bit byte, and so on.
