1)It should be very clear that HtmlUtil.java in the function.problem
 is doing lots more than one thing. 
 It’s creating buffers, 
 fetching pages, 
 searching for inherited pages, 
 rendering paths, 
 appending arcane strings, 
 and generating HTML, among other things.
 
 
 FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.
 
 The problem with this statement is that it is hard to know what “one thing” is. Does Listing 3-3 do one thing? It’s easy to make the case that it’s doing three things:
1. Determining whether the page is a test page.
2. If so, including setups and teardowns.
3. Rendering the page in HTML.
