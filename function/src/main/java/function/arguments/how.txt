1)
The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). 
Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). 
Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. 
More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.

2)
Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice.
