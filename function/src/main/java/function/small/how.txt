1)The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that

2)I was struck by how small all the functions were. 
I was used to func- tions in Swing programs that took up miles of vertical space. 
Every function in this pro- gram was just two, or three, or four lines long. 
Each was transparently obvious. 

3)This implies that the blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should be one line long
