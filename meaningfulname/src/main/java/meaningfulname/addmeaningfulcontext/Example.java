	Imagine that you have variables named firstName, lastName, street, houseNumber, city,
	state, and zipcode. Taken together itâ€™s pretty clear that they form an address.
	But what if you just saw the state variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically
	infer that it was part of an address?
	
			You can add context by using prefixes: addrFirstName, addrLastName, addrState, and so
	on. At least readers will understand that these variables are part of a larger structure
	
	
}
